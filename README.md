# Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph (FRAIG)
This is the final project of Datastructure and Programming.  
It became open and online after the semester I took the course.  
here is the link: https://github.com/ric2k1/DSnP.open

The project here can pass all of the test patterns except one. The bug still hasn't be found yet.  
Thanks to Prof. Chung-Yang Huang for providing such a great course, I really learned a lot.
